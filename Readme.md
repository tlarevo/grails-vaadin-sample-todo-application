# The Todo App
This is a demo todo application developed using Vaddin and Grails frameworks. Primary goal of this application is to understand how Vaading framework and Grails frameworks work together and how we can harness their features to build RIA applications

## For testing out
After cloning this repo, just navigate to app directory and run `./grailsw run-app`

## For development setup
1. First install __gvm__, its single line command, visit http://gvmtool.net
2. Install Groovy using __gvm__
3. Install __Grails__ using __gvm__
4. Clone this repo to your preferred location
5. Navigate into project folder and run `grails` which will get you to __grails__ console
6. In grials console give the command `run-app`
7. Application will compile and run and give you url to view it on the browser
